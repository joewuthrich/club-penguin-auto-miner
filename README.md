# Club Penguin Auto Miner

Don't actually use this (it's against the rules), but I thought it would be an interesting project after watching someone else use one that clearly just had an array of coordinates to move between, making it obvious that cheating was occurring.

This solve that issue by moving around randomly inside a rectangle, and increases efficiency by minimising walking distance between coins.

There's a python version and a js version (the js version is more advanced and works when tabbed off or doing other things, but only comes as a Firefox addon)
